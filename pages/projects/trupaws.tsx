                        For this project we were tasked with finding our own problem area, boiling down to a specific
                        well defined problem and then coming up with a solution for the same. Me and my team ended up
                        choosing pet adoption and animal shelters because most of the members in my team were pet owners
                        in some capacity and we all ended up resonating with this particular problem area

                            would adopt a dog from a shelter. But only 22% of dogs in the US have actually been adopted

                            goods”. This wasn’t always true.

                                them.

                        realized that the 2nd concept, although promising, involved a significant time commitment which
                        might discourage users from adopting a pet altogether. The process of understanding the
                        user&apos;s preferences needed to be quicker.

                    <SectionDescription>
                        The most interesting part of this project was thinking of ways to try and understand the users
                        and shelters and finding a way that they can be matched. We definitely see room for improvement
                        in the way the shelters will be posting their animals onto the platform. Even though the process
                        we came up with is thorough, it does seem to be quite time consuming. Shelters, with their
                        limited resources, would definitely find it challenging to enter so much information for each
                        animal. <p>Overall the entire project was quite enjoyable and challenging at the same time.</p>
