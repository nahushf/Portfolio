                    <SectionDescription>
                        Going through this project certainly was an interesting experience. This was my first project as
                        a grad student pursuing a degree in HCI and it taught/exposed me to a number of aspects
                        regarding working on a design project
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First and foremost this project exposed me to the value of a breadth first approach to
                                brainstorming. To give you some context, While looking at climate change and thinking
                                about the specific problem to tackle, me and my team brainstormed a collection of 50+
                                ideas which helped us look at the problem area from multiple angles and pick out the one
                                problem that resonated with all of us. This breadth first approach to brainstorming has
                                become one of the pillars of my design philosophy ever since.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Secondly, it exposed me to the internal push and pull which is present in any team and
                                helped me think through ways to keep the team dynamics healthy from my end.
                            </li>
