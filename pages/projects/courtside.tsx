                        demonstration was consisted of two parts. One part was the UI and a figma prototype and the
                        second part was a proof on concept demonstrating the movement of a ball using sound.

                        For the UI we started off trying to design a UI targetted at the visually impaired. This
                        involved trying to think how to build a system that could be traversed by someone who cannot
                        see.{' '}

                        Fig1. Initial system design: One initial direction we explored visualized the system as a system
                        of pits where each pit had multiple levels and each pit was analogous to a certain part of the
                        UI, such as a pit for the settings part of the UI, another for accessing games, etc. And each
                        pit had multiple levels that the user could jump between and each level represented substeps in
                        a part of the UI. We imagined we could use a three finger swipe to jump between pits and two
                        finger swipes to jump between levels in a pit

                        With some guidance from William Lawrence who works as an accessibility expert at AT&T, we
                        realized that we can design an ordinary mobile UI and let the inbuilt Talkback and Voice Over
                        features present in the iOS and Android Operating systems handle the accessibility for the
                        visually impaired. Keeping this in mind we designed the following screens

                        hackathon with the intention of winning something. Our main focus the whole time was to build
                        something of value and we believe our product really hit the mark. Not the mention that the
                        prize money was also quite handy.
